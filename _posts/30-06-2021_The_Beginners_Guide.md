title: "The Beginners Guide"
---

It's been a while since I've thought about this game. But "The Beginners Guide" was among my favorite pieces of literature for a long time (probably a little over a year) it's a game that chronicles one game developer's thoughts on another game developers work over the time the other developer was making games. 

What made the game stand out so much to me when I first watched a playthrough of it, and still stands out to me today, is the idea that my job as a creative person isn't to be successful, isn't to make money or be famous. My job is to take the art that lives in my head, and put it into a place that others can experience, whether that's given to an intimate few, or open to absolutely everyone doesn't change that fact.

Looking back, it's probably one of the reasons that I push so hard on creative ventures in my life. There are very few that I've ever finished and there is a part of me that feels guilty about that fact. I put a month into something, or if I'm lucky I put a few months into it, then I get busy with something else, or get bored, or get overwhelmed and move on. Along with those lines, I have a history a mile long of different projects started and abandoned for some reason or another. 

However, that game, it inspired me then, and watching somebody new play it today has inspired me once again. I know what my current projects are, and I'm still working through them now. Being a content creator and making them public knowledge helps me with accountability. There is still a fear in the back of my head fairly regularly that I'm just wasting my time and I'll never amount to anything more than some random line-programmer who makes a decent salary, but never really followed my dreams. 

That being said, I can (once again... I swear this isn't going to be something I do every post here) really only thank those of you who are supporting me by watching my streams. With your help I might just be able to follow my dreams and be able to actually create the art I have locked in my head full time.
