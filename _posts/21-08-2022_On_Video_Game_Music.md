title: "On Video Game Music"

Y'all know I'm at least somewhat interested in game development, right? Well, I was just listening to my instrumental playlist, and stumbled across some Minecraft music and it reminded me of this little thing that I think is oh, so important in games.

In games that are atmospheric, your music should be rare, pull the listener further into the game, and pertinent to what's currently going on. Minecraft checked 2 of those boxes for a long time, and even still, music doesn't play all of the time. Mice on Venus is one of the songs that stands out most to me, I have some distinct memories and "flavors" that crop up whenever I listen to it. 

As a music producer, one of my dreams is to develop the sound track for the game I wanna make, but I wanna make a soundtrack of the likes that nobody has heard before, I want it to feel like there is an improvisational band that is watching what you're doing and playing along to it, and I've designed a lot of the systems that would let me run music like that in the game. Just imagine Breath of the Wild, where you run up to a cliff, and the music swells as you get closer to the edge, hitting a crescendo while you're on the crest, looking out on the landscape. You jump off the cliff and for a breath, while you're falling the music is still there, but it's sucked away by the wind rushing by your ears (or just filtered to heck and back) until you pull out your glider, then it comes back but it feels different, you're soaring like an eagle, and the music is soaring with you. 

That's just a taste of the dream that simmers in the back of my head, it's what I want, but I have no idea if I'll ever have the skills to produce music that will be able to induce all of the feelings I know I'll want it to induce, and have them be able to flow into each other, be mixed and matched to build the perfect sound for the moment. And at the same time have it be performant enough to not cause a problem with the rest of the game.
