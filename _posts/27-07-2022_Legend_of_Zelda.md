title: "Legend of Zelda"

Long time, no talk. Today I've been listening to a new Jacob Geller video about the Zelda series. I may talk about other games being my favorite, or anything along those lines, but the Zelda series, is by far my favorite for so, so many reasons. Lemme just go through a few here.

Breath of the Wild brings in so many pieces of the "perfect video game for me" puzzle into one place. A exploratory sandbox, the ability to go where you want, to fight and struggle, to succeed and to fail, to make your own story within a dying world that still has just a bit of hope ringing the edges. However it fails me in one key way. Breath of the Wild doesn't provide enough progression for me, sure you get armor and upgrade it over time, but you don't get tools that let you interact with your environment more beyond leaving the Great Plateau... That being said, I love the story so much, and it's a gorgeous game, both in graphics and music.

Phantom Hourglass was the first Zelda game I ever beat, so it holds a special place in my heart. Specifically, the main dungeon in it is just perfect, yet horrible at the same time. The fact that you are time-limited and surrounded by (essentially) invulnerable enemies leaves a sense of dread around every turn. The story itself doesn't stand out to me as much, but the game being a sequel to Wind Waker just makes so much of it that much more interesting to me.

While I have never completed Skyward Sword, I fell in love with it and just ended up getting stuck at one point in it. A lot of people dislike the motion controls, but I feel, in a lot of ways, it is the best implementation, the most meaningful implementation of motion controls in any game I've played. It stands out first and foremost because of those controls to me.
