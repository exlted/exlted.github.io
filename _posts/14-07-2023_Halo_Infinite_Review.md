title: "Halo Infinite Review"

So... My belated review on Halo Infinite, as I was finally able to actually launch the game to finish the campaign.

At the start, it felt like a big mission that I was able to go where I wanted, and the FOBs felt enough like set-pieces that it didn't feel so off-putting to have an open world.
However, quickly after that, the open world felt stale and samey to me, the missions in general were okay, but...

I really didn't like how they implemented bosses, at all... Looking back, I have a hard time thinking of any boss fight that I actually thought was good and not just frustrating. Sure, winning a hard fight after a bunch of tries feels good, but for a game that never really had bosses outside of a final boss or two, they had so, so many. And most of them were just bad gimmicks turned up to 11.

The ending stretch (or more like, ending slog) was corridor shooter between boss fights it seemed. All of which followed the standard of boss fights from the rest of the game. Unfun, and frustrating. 

Story wise and music wise, it's a Halo game. Which means good music, if you like the style, and at least a fully baked story. Though, it does feel like there's a good... quarter to a third of the story ripped out because they just couldn't get it done on time.

Overall, I think Halo can be an open world game, but if you're going to do so, you really need to focus on the set-pieces and limit the standard open world fare of sprinkling a bunch of the same stuff around the world for people to find (primarily talking about the fights, you can put audio logs and such, those don't really affect the gameplay IMO), but Halo Infinite is not a good open world Halo game.

If they released the first couple hours of the open world as a demo, I would be hyped for the game. But playing past that point, I honestly can't suggest it for anyone who isn't in it for the story
