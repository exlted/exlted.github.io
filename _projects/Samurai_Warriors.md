title: Samurai Warriors
description: Terminal Roguelike Game
---
Samurai Warriors is a simple game developed with a friend as the "bonus project" for our first programming class in college. Written in C#, it shows the beginnings of my journey into game development.

I've personally been interested in games which use random generation to provide additional gameplay value for a long time, and dungeon generation seemed like it would be a relatively simple way to use random generation in a game where I was largely learning the programming language at the same time. And if we're generating dungeons, why not make a dungeon crawler? Enemies were honestly an afterthought in the development process, so the "combat" isn't the best designed part of the game, but it's what made it into a game rather than a tech demo.

From a programmer's perspective, this is one of my first "major" projects, obviously I'd do almost everything in the codebase differently today. But I'm really proud that it works in the first place.
