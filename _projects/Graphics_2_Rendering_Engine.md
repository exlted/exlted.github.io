title: Graphics 2 Rendering Engine
description: Collegiate Experience in Rendering
---
During College, one of my major projects was to develop a rendering engine using DirectX. This project really just proves that I have done low-level rendering work before.

In this project, I did the following.
* Model Loading
* Texturing
* Instancing
* Multi-model Updating & Rendering
* Wrote basic HLSL shader files
* Infinite Skybox using Cube Texture
* Lighting
* Specular and Normal mapping
* Grayscale Post Processing
* Render to Texture & using that texture in the scene
* Multi-Viewport rendering

While I'm not overly proud of this work, I haven't made any projects since this that prove that I have a level of understanding with this low-level of rendering, so I felt it was still important to have in my portfolio.

Technologies Used

* C++
