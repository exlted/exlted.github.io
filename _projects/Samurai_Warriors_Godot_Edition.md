title: Samurai Warriors Godot Edition
description: Remake of an Old Project to learn Godot
---
Over the past year or so, I've been trying to find a game engine/toolkit that I want to learn more to start working on games again. This was my project to learn about Godot. Additionally, this project was done after giving up on Samurai Warriors Derusted, so I tried to not make the same mistakes with the order I had developed that game in so that I'd hopefully be more inspired to actually finish the game, rather than abandon it in progress. Sadly, that didn't end up working out for a few reasons, and this project is also abandoned.

With Derusted, I started by developing world generation and doing things to make the Bevy framework work in a way I wanted it to work. With Godot Edition, I decided I wanted to start with player & enemy movement before doing anything else so that it would feel 'more' like a game. 

My biggest joy in this project is actually how simple I was able to make the [Turn Controller](https://github.com/exlted/Samurai-Warriors-Godot-Edition/blob/master/scripts/TurnController.cs) for it. It simply uses a Queue and Signals to keep track of which entity has turn order.

In the end though, I ended up abandoning this project due to frustrations I had with using C# in Godot and will probably not return to it in the future.
