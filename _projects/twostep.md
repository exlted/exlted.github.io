description: Experiments in Developing a Message Router
---
During the process of figuring out how to engineer using microservices, and before I learned about Message Queues, I started by developing twostep. Twostep was my initial exploration into websockets and Docker and was going to be developed into a whole Message Queuing system until I learned about pre-existing ones that I could use instead.

From a code perspective, there really isn't much to look at, but the thought process towards solving the problems I was dealing with is why this is on my portfolio. I may not always know what I'm looking for, but one of my skills I'm most proud of is being able to analyze a problem and write code that generically fixes the problem I was dealing with. 

Sadly, most of the "problem solving" code that I actually use regularly I'm not able to share due to it being done for my job. But, know that the greatest addition I bring to my teams is that I notice problems that we're dealing with over and over, and I can engineer a solution to that problem. It isn't a perfect solution on the first pass, but once it's available, other team members can start to see changes that will make it work better for the issues they deal with.
